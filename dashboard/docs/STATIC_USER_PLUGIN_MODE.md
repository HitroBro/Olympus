# Static User-Plugin Mode

Current hardened Hermes serves static dashboard assets from non-bundled user and project plugins, but does not import their Python backend APIs. For Olympus this means `/olympus` can render while `/api/plugins/olympus/*` returns `404`.

## Frontend fallback

When `dashboard/dist/index.js` cannot load `/api/plugins/olympus/overview`, it switches to a frontend-only compatibility view. The fallback only calls existing Hermes dashboard APIs through `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.fetchJSON` so dashboard auth/session handling stays owned by Hermes.

| Existing Hermes API | Static mode use | Olympus panel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/dashboard/plugins` | Confirm Olympus manifest discovery, source, and `has_api` status. | Static User-Plugin Mode notice, Diagnostics evidence source |
| `GET /api/status` | Show Hermes version/auth/gateway count shape when available. | Diagnostics evidence source |
| `GET /api/profiles` | Count profiles without showing local profile names. | Agent Monitor count, Profile Fitness placeholder |
| `GET /api/skills` | Count installed, enabled, and never-used skills plus provenance class counts (hub/bundled/agent), never showing skill names. | Skill Coverage/Hygiene count summaries |
| `GET /api/sessions/stats` | Count sessions (total, active store, archived), message count, and source-kind count without reading transcript bodies. | Performance Tracking session lanes |
| `GET /api/cron/jobs` | Count cron jobs and enabled/disabled split without showing job names or mutating schedule state. | Performance Tracking cron lane |

## Hidden or labelled in static mode

These panels require bundled/trusted Olympus backend synthesis and are hidden, empty, or explicitly labelled as unavailable in the fallback:

- Readiness scoring and score deductions.
- Kanban board synthesis, Trace Spine, and worker attention items.
- Skill hygiene/audit synthesis and profile fitness scoring.
- Tool policy, config risk, and auxiliary cost recommendations.
- Operational evals and production diagnostics from Olympus evidence collectors.

## Why not synthesize everything in the browser?

The first-party Hermes dashboard APIs are page APIs, not Olympus' redacted operations model. Rebuilding Olympus synthesis in browser JavaScript would either duplicate backend collectors, increase local-label/privacy risk, or start inspecting config/env/session details directly from the plugin frontend. Static mode therefore stays deliberately narrow: counts, compatibility status, links to Hermes-owned pages, and a clear recommendation to use bundled/trusted backend mode for full Olympus.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run verify
npm run test:compat
npx playwright test tests/visual/olympus.spec.js -g "static user-plugin mode"
```

`npm run test:compat` identifies whether the live Hermes instance is serving Olympus as a static user plugin or with mounted backend routes.
